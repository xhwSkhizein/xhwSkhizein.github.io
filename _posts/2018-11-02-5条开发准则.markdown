[5 Laws every developer should know](https://blog.ippon.tech/5-laws-every-developer-should-know/)

### Murphy’s Law

> "If anything can go wrong, it will."

### Knuth’s Law

> “Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.”

### North’s Law

> “Every decision is a trade off.”

### Conway’s Law

> “Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”

### Law of triviality (Parkinson's law of triviality)

> “Members of an organization give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.”

### Conclusion

These 5 laws are only a few examples of old lessons learned in our industry. There are many more to learn and discover when gaining more experience in the software development trenches.

Even if some of them may be seen as common-sense now, I strongly believe that knowing these principles will help you recognize patterns and react to them.
